# Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
 
This week, I created a wooden tea coaster using the laser cutter at Jacobs. The design was inspired by traditional Japanese wave patterns and I chose this design because I wanted to create a timeless tea coaster that I could use in the future.

Since it was my first time using the laser cutter, I worked with Jeongmin to use the laser cutter. Our initial design on Adobe Illustrator could not identify the cutting lines, so we had to re-iterate and update the design several times, which took longer than we expected.
